 TransBorder Freight Data Analysis Project

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes cross-border freight transportation data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) using the CRISP-DM methodology. The goal is to uncover insights into freight movement, identify inefficiencies, and provide actionable recommendations on safety, environmental impact, and economic disruptions.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Uncover freight movement patterns
- Identify operational inefficiencies
- Investigate the effect of economic disruptions

## Executive Summary
This report presents a multi-year analysis of freight transport data with a focus on temporal trends, transport mode efficiencies, shipment characteristics, and geographic flows. Using Python-based tools, the data is evaluated across several years to identify performance improvements, inefficiencies, and strategic opportunities. The insights help stakeholders better understand how freight transport patterns evolve over time, enabling smarter decisions around infrastructure, cost management, and sustainability.

## Introduction
Understanding how freight logistics change over time is essential for planning future transport networks, managing costs, and achieving sustainability goals. This report analyzes freight transport data across multiple years to uncover variations in shipment volumes, mode utilization, geographic distribution, and cost efficiency. The analysis uses visualization and statistical techniques implemented in Python to provide a clear understanding of how logistics patterns shift year-over-year.

## Data Overview
Dataset Composition:
Years Covered: 2020 to 2024
The dataset includes the following key variables:

* Origin and Destination (city/country)
* Mode of Transport (Road, Rail, Air, Sea)
* Shipment Weight and Volume
* Transport Distance (km)
* Transport Cost
* Shipment Frequency

Initial data cleaning was performed to handle missing values, normalize data formats, and ensure consistency across categorical variables.



## Key Findings
### Transport Mode Utilization
* Road transport dominates short-distance routes, especially for regional shipments.
* Rail transport is underutilized despite cost-efficiency in bulk and long-distance freight.
* Air freight accounts for the smallest share but is primarily used for time-sensitive deliveries.
* Sea freight is heavily used for international trade, particularly for high-weight shipments.

### Shipment Weight Distribution
* Majority of shipments fall within the 1â€“10 tons weight bracket.
* Heavy shipments (>20 tons) are more common in sea and rail transport, suggesting optimal mode selection based on weight.

### Geographic Insights
* High-volume corridors include major cities and ports.
* A notable clustering of shipments was observed around central logistics hubs, suggesting strategic network positioning.

### Transport Efficiency
* Efficiency metrics show that rail and sea provide better cost-per-ton-km ratios.
* Air transport has the highest cost and carbon footprint per unit, justifying its use only when necessary.
* Road transport shows a moderate balance but presents congestion issues in urban centers.

## Recommendations
### Optimize Mode Selection
* Encourage modal shift from road to rail or sea where feasible to reduce costs and emissions.
* Improve infrastructure to support intermodal transport systems.

### Improve Route Planning
* Leverage data to identify optimal shipping routes, reducing distance and fuel consumption.
* Use AI-assisted logistics for real-time route adjustments.

### Invest in Rail and Sea Logistics
* Rail networks need better integration and investment to support bulk inland transport.
* Sea freight logistics could be enhanced with digitization and port automation.

### Sustainability and Emissions Tracking
* Adopt greener practices through low-emission transport modes.
* Track COâ‚‚ emissions per shipment and incorporate sustainability KPIs into logistics planning.

## Conclusion
The freight transport dataset reveals a number of actionable insights that can help optimize logistics strategies. A shift towards more cost-effective and sustainable transport modes, coupled with data-driven planning, can significantly enhance operational efficiency. Further analysis integrating real-time tracking and external data (e.g., weather, traffic) is recommended for predictive modeling and dynamic optimization.
